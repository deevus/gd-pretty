# Ticket: Update writeClassDefinition for Comment Support

## Epic
Comment-Aware Processing

## Summary
Update `writeClassDefinition` to handle comments between structural elements, particularly between the colon (`:`) and the class body.

## Description
Replace the rigid direct indexing approach in `writeClassDefinition` with the flexible skip-and-process pattern that can handle comments appearing between the class declaration colon and the body node.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Implement skip-and-process pattern
- [x] Replace direct `node.child(i)` access for body with iterative approach
- [x] Handle `.comment` nodes by calling `handleComment()`
- [x] Find and process `.body` node after handling any intermediate comments
- [x] Maintain proper error handling for unexpected node types

### 2. Preserve existing functionality
- [x] All existing class definition formatting behavior preserved
- [x] Proper indentation and structure maintained
- [x] No regressions in existing test cases

### 3. Handle edge cases
- [x] Multiple consecutive comments between `:` and body
- [x] Empty comment content
- [x] Mixed inline and standalone comments
- [x] No comments (original behavior preserved)

### 4. Add comprehensive testing
- [x] Test `class X: # comment` inline comment case
- [x] Test multiple comments between colon and body
- [x] Test existing functionality still works (regression testing)
- [x] Update or create snapshot tests for comment scenarios

#### Specific Test Cases Required
- [x] **Inline comment after class declaration**: `class X: # comment`
- [x] **Multiple consecutive comments**: Multiple comments between `:` and body
- [x] **Empty comment content**: `class X: #` (edge case)
- [x] **Comments with special characters**: Unicode, symbols, mixed content
- [x] **Mixed inline and standalone comments**: Complex comment patterns
- [x] **No comments**: Original behavior preserved (regression testing)

#### Output Quality Validation
- [x] **Proper indentation**: Comments maintain consistent indentation with class structure
- [x] **Spacing consistency**: Exactly one space before inline comments (`class X: # comment`)
- [x] **Newline handling**: Proper newline placement after comments
- [x] **Comment content preservation**: Original comment text preserved exactly
- [x] **No formatting artifacts**: No extra spaces, missing characters, or malformed output

#### Integration Testing
- [x] **Nested classes**: Comments in nested class structures
- [x] **Classes with multiple methods**: Comment handling doesn't affect method processing
- [x] **Class inheritance**: Comments with extends/inherits syntax
- [x] **Complex class bodies**: Mixed statements, properties, and comments

## Implementation Notes

### Pattern Transformation
Replace this rigid approach:
```zig
// Current failing code
const body_node = node.child(i) orelse return Error.MissingRequiredChild;
if (body_node.getTypeAsEnum(NodeType) != .body) {
    log.err("Expected body node, got {s}", .{body_node.getTypeAsString()});
    return Error.UnexpectedNodeType;
}
try self.writeBody(body_node);
```

With this flexible approach:
```zig
// New comment-aware code
var current_index = i;
var found_body = false;

while (current_index < node.childCount()) {
    const child = node.child(current_index) orelse break;

    switch (child.getTypeAsEnum(NodeType) orelse .unknown) {
        .comment => {
            try self.handleComment(child);
            current_index += 1;
            continue;
        },
        .body => {
            try self.writeBody(child);
            found_body = true;
            break;
        },
        else => {
            log.err("Expected body or comment after class declaration, got {s}", .{child.getTypeAsString()});
            return Error.UnexpectedNodeType;
        }
    }
}

if (!found_body) {
    return Error.MissingRequiredChild;
}
```

### Target Test Case
The implementation should successfully format:
```gd
class X: # inline comment
    func foo():
        pass
```

Expected output:
```gd
class X: # inline comment
    func foo():
        pass
```

#### Current Issue Analysis
The current output from `inline_comments_on_compound_stmts.out.gd` shows:
```gd
pass

class X:
 # aaa
        func foo():
 # bbb
                pass
```

**Critical Issues to Fix:**
- [x] **Incorrect indentation**: Comments should be properly indented relative to their context
- [x] **Missing inline comment positioning**: `class X: # aaa` should keep comment on same line
- [x] **Broken comment-to-code association**: Comments appear disconnected from their associated elements
- [x] **Excessive indentation**: Function and statements have incorrect indentation levels
- [x] **Missing proper spacing**: No space before inline comments

#### Quality Validation Criteria
- [x] **Inline comments**: Must appear on same line as associated declaration with exactly one space before `#`
- [x] **Standalone comments**: Must be indented to match the level of the next statement
- [x] **Consistent indentation**: All elements maintain proper relative indentation (4 spaces per level)
- [x] **No extra whitespace**: No trailing spaces, excessive blank lines, or formatting artifacts

## Files to Modify
- `src/GdWriter.zig` - Update `writeClassDefinition` method
- `tests/input-output-pairs/inline_comments_on_compound_stmts.in.gd` - Use as test case
