# Ticket: Performance Validation and Optimization

## Epic
Comment-Aware Processing

## Summary
Validate that the comment-aware processing implementation maintains acceptable performance characteristics and doesn't introduce significant overhead compared to the previous rigid parsing approach.

## Description
Measure and validate the performance impact of the new comment-aware processing system, ensuring that the runtime processing approach doesn't introduce unacceptable overhead for typical and large GDScript files.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Performance Baseline Establishment
- [ ] Measure performance of formatter before comment-aware changes (baseline)
- [ ] Create standardized test files for performance measurement
- [ ] Document baseline performance metrics (time, memory usage)
- [ ] Establish acceptable performance thresholds

### 2. Comment Processing Performance Validation
- [ ] Measure performance with comment-aware implementation
- [ ] Compare against baseline performance
- [ ] Verify overhead is within acceptable limits (<10% slowdown)
- [ ] Test with various comment density scenarios

### 3. Large File Performance Testing
- [ ] Test with large GDScript files (>1000 lines)
- [ ] Test with high comment-to-code ratios (50%+ comments)
- [ ] Test with deeply nested structures containing comments
- [ ] Verify no exponential performance degradation

### 4. Memory Usage Validation
- [ ] Monitor memory consumption during comment processing
- [ ] Ensure no memory leaks in comment handling
- [ ] Verify memory usage scales linearly with file size
- [ ] Test with multiple large files processed sequentially

#### Enhanced Memory Testing from Comprehensive Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Arena allocator efficiency**: Validate efficient memory allocation patterns for comment processing
- [ ] **Memory pressure scenarios**: Test with limited memory conditions
- [ ] **Large comment content**: Test memory usage with very long individual comments
- [ ] **Comment density impact**: Measure memory scaling with high comment-to-code ratios
- [ ] **Multiple file processing**: Sequential processing of many comment-heavy files

### 5. Edge Case Performance
- [ ] Files with thousands of consecutive comments
- [ ] Files with very long individual comments
- [ ] Files with comments containing special characters or unicode
- [ ] Stress testing with malformed comment structures

#### Integration with Comprehensive Testing Scenarios
From ticket #005, validate performance with these specific comment scenarios:
- [ ] **Inline comments after declarations**: Performance impact of `class X: # comment` patterns
- [ ] **Standalone comments between statements**: Processing cost of comment blocks
- [ ] **Multiple consecutive comments**: Performance scaling with comment density
- [ ] **Mixed inline and standalone**: Cost of comment classification and processing
- [ ] **Complex nested structures**: Performance with deeply nested comments
- [ ] **Empty comment handling**: Overhead of processing comments with no content
- [ ] **Special character processing**: Unicode and symbol processing performance

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Test Setup
Create performance benchmarking infrastructure:
```bash
# Benchmark script structure
./scripts/benchmark.sh baseline    # Run without comment processing
./scripts/benchmark.sh current     # Run with comment processing
./scripts/benchmark.sh compare     # Compare results
```

### Test File Categories

#### Small Files (< 100 lines)
- [ ] Simple classes with mixed comments
- [ ] Functions with various comment patterns
- [ ] Basic regression testing

#### Medium Files (100-1000 lines)
- [ ] Complex class hierarchies with comments
- [ ] Multiple files with realistic comment distribution
- [ ] Typical project file sizes

#### Large Files (1000+ lines)
- [ ] Auto-generated large GDScript files
- [ ] Files with extreme comment density
- [ ] Stress testing scenarios

### Performance Metrics to Track

#### Time-based Metrics
- [ ] Total processing time per file
- [ ] Processing time per line of code
- [ ] Processing time per comment
- [ ] Time spent in comment-specific code paths

#### Memory-based Metrics
- [ ] Peak memory usage during processing
- [ ] Memory allocation patterns
- [ ] Memory usage per comment processed
- [ ] Overall memory efficiency

### Performance Thresholds

#### Acceptable Performance Criteria
- **Time overhead**: <10% increase in processing time
- **Memory overhead**: <5% increase in peak memory usage
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling with file size and comment count
- **Reliability**: No crashes or timeouts on large files

#### Performance Warning Thresholds
- **Time overhead**: 5-10% increase triggers investigation
- **Memory overhead**: 3-5% increase triggers monitoring
- **Large file handling**: >10 seconds for 10k line files
- **Memory usage**: >100MB for typical project files

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Baseline Measurement
```bash
# Before implementing comment processing
for file in test_files/*.gd; do
    time ./zig-out/bin/gd-pretty "$file" > /dev/null
done
```

### 2. Performance Profiling
- Use Zig's built-in profiling tools if available
- Implement timing measurements around comment processing code
- Monitor memory allocation patterns
- Track function call frequency and duration

### 3. Optimization Opportunities
If performance issues are found:
- [ ] Cache comment classification results
- [ ] Optimize string processing in comment handling
- [ ] Reduce memory allocations in hot paths
- [ ] Consider lazy evaluation for comment processing

### Example Benchmarking Code
```zig
// Add to main.zig for benchmarking
const start_time = std.time.nanoTimestamp();
// ... format file ...
const end_time = std.time.nanoTimestamp();
const duration_ms = @divFloor(end_time - start_time, 1_000_000);
std.debug.print("Processing time: {}ms\n", .{duration_ms});
```
